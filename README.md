🛡️ Ransomware Detection

This repository contains a Google Colab Notebook implementation for detecting ransomware activity using machine learning techniques. The notebook analyzes data, extracts features, and trains machine learning models to classify whether system behavior is benign or malicious.

🦠 About Ransomware

Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that blocks access to a computer system or encrypts files, and then demands a ransom payment from the victim to restore access.

🔑 Key Characteristics

🗂️ Encryption of files: Makes important files inaccessible.

💰 Ransom demand: Attackers demand payment (often in cryptocurrency).

📩 Spread mechanisms: Email attachments, infected downloads, or network vulnerabilities.

🚨 High impact: Leads to financial losses and downtime.

⚠️ Real-World Examples

WannaCry (2017): Spread worldwide, affecting hospitals, companies, and governments.

NotPetya (2017): Caused billions in damages, hitting multinational corporations.

Ryuk: Targeted enterprises with high ransom demands.

🛡️ Why Detection is Important

Prevents file encryption before it spreads.

Protects organizations from financial and reputational damage.

Improves cybersecurity resilience.
