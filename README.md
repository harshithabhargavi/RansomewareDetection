🛡️ Ransomware Detection

This repository contains a Google Colab Notebook implementation for detecting ransomware activity using machine learning techniques. The notebook analyzes data, extracts features, and trains machine learning models to classify whether system behavior is benign or malicious.

🦠 About Ransomware

Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that blocks access to a computer system or encrypts files, and then demands a ransom payment from the victim to restore access.

🔑 Key Characteristics:

Encryption of files: Ransomware often encrypts important files, making them inaccessible.

Ransom demand: Attackers demand payment (often in cryptocurrency) to provide the decryption key.

Spread mechanisms: It can spread via malicious email attachments, infected downloads, or network vulnerabilities.

High impact: Targets individuals, organizations, and even critical infrastructure, leading to financial losses and downtime.

⚠️ Real-World Examples:

WannaCry (2017): Spread rapidly worldwide, affecting hospitals, companies, and governments.

NotPetya (2017): Caused billions in damages, targeting multinational corporations.

Ryuk: Known for targeting enterprises and demanding large ransoms.

🛡️ Why Detection is Important

Ransomware attacks are increasing in both frequency and sophistication. Early detection can:

Prevent encryption of sensitive files.

Protect organizations from financial losses.

Enhance cybersecurity resilience.
